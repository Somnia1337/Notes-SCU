# Somnia1337's Notes

The notes Somnia1337 had taken with Obsidian and Markdown.

## How to Use

Downloading [Obsidian](obsidian.md)(the markdown editor I've been using) is recommended, you can also open the markdown files with notepad(deprecated, with the effects such as bold, highlight and code blocks not rendered).

## Common Issues

Reporting errors or typos in my notes is welcomed, feel free to PR.
