# Somnia1337's Notes

The notes Somnia1337 had taken with Obsidian and Markdown.

## How to Use

Go to "Releases" and download the latest .zip file, unzip it, and you'll see the .md note files.

Downloading [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)(the markdown editor I've been using) is recommended, you can also open the markdown files with notepad(deprecated, without effect rendering).

## Common Issues

Reporting the errors or typos in my notes is welcomed, feel free to PR.
