# Somnia1337's Notes

The notes Somnia1337 had taken with Obsidian and Markdown.

## How to Use

Go to "Releases" and download the latest `.zip` file, unzip it, and you'll see the `.md` note files.

I recommend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - the markdown editor I've been using - to view my notes, it has an elegant UI and a fluent editing experience.

## Common Issues

Reporting the errors or typos in my notes is welcomed, feel free to PR.
